					<h2>How can we invest to make science more innovative and impactful? A case study for the Director of the National Institutes of Health</h2>
					<p>The National Institutes of Health invests over $30 billion every year in extramural research, largely through almost 50,000 competitive grants to 300,000 researchers at more than 2,500 universities, medical schools, and other research institutions in every state. Patients, physicians, advocacy groups, journalists, scholars, and policymakers have all wondered publicly about the value of billions of dollars in government-supported research. This directed study will examine how scientists, policymakers, and funding agencies measure the value and impact of their work and investments. We will do this using a case study developed from an evaluation that I heaped lead for the Director of the National Institutes of Health where he asked us to determine whether his investments in “high-risk, high-reward” research had improved impact and innovation.</p>
