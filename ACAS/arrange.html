<p><font size="+2">Conference Facility:</font></p>
<p>The conference and preceding short course will take place at George Mason University in Fairfax, VA. 
There is a Mason Shuttle from Vienna Station Orange Line to Fairfax Campus. You can pick this up at the 
North Side of Vienna Station. The building used as our conference center is the HUB, building 56 on
the map. It is a short walk from the Metro Bus stop on campus. <br><br>If driving, the Shendandoah Parking Garage 
is the closest to the HUB that has public parking. Most of the spots are reserved, but metered parking is available
for visitors. It is located off of Patriot Circle on the East side of the campus. A walkway takes
you directly to the HUB.
