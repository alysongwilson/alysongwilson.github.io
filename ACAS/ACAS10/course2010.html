						and How to Use Them<br>

		<p>Early designed experiments in agriculture required a statistician tovcreate a design and analyze the data. As DOE has transcended its rootsvin agriculture, the lack of statisticians relative to the number ofvpotential applications of DOE makes professional statistical involvement in every experimental study infeasible. One way of dealing with this scarcity is to use tabled sample plans that are available in textbooks on designed experiments. These plans typically have very desirable statistical properties and have a fairly wide range of applicability. This &quot;one size fits all&quot; approach to design choice is quite popular.</p>
		<p>Recently, a viable alternative has arisen due to a huge increase in the power of computers and their accompanying software. A computer-aided approach to DOE offers the possibility of a tailored approach to design as opposed the to the &quot;one size fits all&quot; approach. As a result interest in design of experiments (DOX) has greatly increased in recent years. Many organizations have effectively integrated the design of experiments methodology into their overall operational improvement strategy, including those deploying six sigma and design for six sigma (DFSS). DOX is the most powerful of the six sigma tools, and its impact on product design and development, manufacturing, and production operations can be profound.</p>
		<p>Well-designed experiments are a powerful tool for developing and validating cause and effect relationships when evaluating and improving product and process performance. Designed experiments are the only efficient way to verify the impact of changes in product or process factors on actual performance.</p>
		<p>This course on DOX is unique in that it discusses new approaches to choosing a design and analyzing the resulting data that have only been recently available. These methods allow you to solve the most complex experimental design problems easily and directly using the same general approach.</p>
		<p>The course is taught by two internationally known experts in the field, one of whom is the author of the most widely-used textbook on the subject. The instructors have over 60 years of experience in teaching and using DOX in a wide variety of industrial end business settings. The course focuses on several major aspects of DOX, including both the practical and the statistical aspects, and interpretation of results.</p>
