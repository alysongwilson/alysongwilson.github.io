color=#770000>Information on the Content of this CD</FONT></B>

<P><FONT color=black> This CD contains Proceedings of the Army Conference on Applied Statistics (ACAS)
for the year 2003 held in Napa Valley, California and hosted by Professor Francisco Samaniego and 
the University of California, Davis.

<P>Authors represented on this CD were offered the opportunity not 
only to provide written articles, but also to provide supplementary materials 
including PowerPoint presentations, animations, color illustrations, software 
code, and data files. Many chose to do so; indeed, some authors provided 
PowerPoint presentations, but no written articles. For this reason, we have 
chosen to present materials in both an Adobe pdf format 
and in a web-based html format. These files may be found in the root 
directory of the ACAS 2003 CD. The <A HREF="Master03.pdf">Master03.pdf</A> file is a "book image" file, i.e. is the 
electronic form of the traditional book for the 2003 Proceedings. If a PowerPoint 
presentation was provided, we have provided the PowerPoint 
presentation within the Master files. Some presenters chose not to provide 
any material for the Proceedings. In those cases, their abstracts appear in the original website only.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT color=#770000>About Adobe pdf Files</FONT></B><FONT color=#770000> 
-</FONT> In general, Adobe pdf files may be supplied with embedded fonts or as 
bit-mapped images. Generally speaking, articles that were supplied to the 
editors as postscript files, especially those edited on Unix machines, are 
produced as bit-mapped pdf files, while those originating on Windows/Intel 
machines with scalable fonts are produced as pdf files with embedded fonts. The 
bit-mapped pdf files have poorer screen resolution, but are essentially 
indistinguishable from pdfs with embedded fonts in high-resolution printed 
versions. Please also note that, because of limitations in Adobe Acrobat, it is 
not possible to add page numbers after individual postscript or pdf files have 
been produced. Thus although page numbers are assigned to individual articles in 
the table of contents, the page numbers do not appear on the individual 
articles. </P>

<P>Please note that the pdf files in this volume were produced with Adobe 
Acrobat 8.0. Earlier versions of Acrobat Reader may not be able to read the pdf 
files produced with Adobe Acrobat 8.0. If you do not have Acrobat Reader a current 
version may be downloaded for free. The Readers are backwards compatible. You may log 
in directly to the <A href="http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobat/readstep.html">Adobe website</A> to 
obtain a current version of Acrobat Reader for your operating system.</P>

<P><B><FONT color=#770000>Navigating this CD</FONT></B><FONT color=#770000> 
-</FONT> Some authors provided additional materials that were not linkable 
within the Adobe pdf framework. For this reason and in order to provide more 
direct access to individual files, we have provided access through a web 
browser. This CD provides not only the book image Master file, but also 
individual files provided by the authors. These are accessible through the 
<A HREF="index.html">index.html</A> file. The reader may link to individual articles through the 
Author Index. 

<P>Using the features of web browsers can greatly assist in navigating this 
volume. For example, using the browser's FIND tool in the Table of Contents 
allows one to search for either keywords or authors. In the Author Index, 
authors are arranged alphabetically by last name. Authors who supplied no 
additional materials other than the original abstract have no links. Their 
abstracts are available on the original website. This volume contains the entire 
contents of the original website, which is linked through the index.html file. 

<P><B><FONT color=#770000>Citation Format for Articles in this 
Volume</FONT></B><FONT color=#770000> - </FONT>This volume is presented on a 
compact disc, but as mentioned earlier contains in electronic files
the image of the printed volume. For those interested in hard copy, printing 
Master files on a duplex color laser printer will result a paper copy of the 
volume, which may be bound. Because of this, citations from this volume may be 
given in a traditional manner. Examples are given below.</P>

<P>Page numbers are the traditional means of uniquely locating an article within 
a paper volume. For an electronic volume, the directory structure uniquely 
locates an article within the electronic volume. Therefore, an alternative 
citation may be given by giving the appropriate directory location for the 
article. An example is given below.</P>
