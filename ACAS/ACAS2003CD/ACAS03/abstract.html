<P><FONT size=+2>Instructions</FONT></P>
<P>Abstracts may be submitted for consideration in a contributed/technical or 
clinical session. Descriptions of both session types are given below. Each 
submission should contain the following information.</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>1. Title of paper and short abstract written in standard ASCII text.</P>
  <P>2. Name of author(s) and exact title of the organization(s).</P>
  <P>3. Type of paper (technical or clinical).</P>
  <P>4. Equipment needed (overhead, slide projector, etc.).</P>
  <P>5. Telephone number of the author (DSN or commercial).</P>
  <P>6. E-mail address of the author(s).</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Submissions should arrive by 22 August to:</P>
<P><A href="mailto:Barry%20A.%20Bodt%20<babodt@arl.army.mil>">Barry Bodt</A>, 
babodt@arl.army.mil. Note: MS Word attachments using standard ASCII characters 
are most convenient.</P>
<P>Submissions may also be mailed to:</P>

<P><FONT size=+2>Technical Papers</FONT></P>
<P>Contributed/technical papers can vary in content from new research to 
well-posed problems in which statistical methods are applied to solve specific 
Army problems. Speakers are strongly encouraged to present their papers in terms 
of the potential or real problems that motivated the work. Where the solution to 
a problem relies on relatively recent or specialized results in the theory of 
statistics and probability, these results should be explained or documented in 
sufficient detail to permit an audience of statistical practitioners with 
broadly varying backgrounds to utilize the results to enhance their problem 
solving capabilities.</P>
<P><FONT size=+2>Clinical Papers</FONT></P>
<P>A distinct feature of this conference is the Clinical Session. Presentations 
feature applied statistics problems which have not been completely or 
satisfactorily solved, and for which the presenter seeks assistance in 
developing a satisfactory approach. A panel of experts, composed of invited 
speakers and other distinguished attendees, convenes for each clinical session 
to provide guidance. Authors of a clinical paper must provide a brief 
description of the problem by 21 September so that the panelists have sufficient 
time to prepare their recommendations. We invite you to consider this 
opportunity to present an interesting statistical problem to some of the 
country's leading applied and mathematical statisticians.</P>
<P><FONT size=+2>Presentation Time</FONT></P>
<P>Technical papers are nominally allowed 30 minutes, to include 5 minutes at 
the end for audience discussion and questions. Of the 40 minutes available for 
clinical papers, approximately 15 minutes are recommended for the problem 
statement, allowing 25 minutes for panel discussion.</P>
