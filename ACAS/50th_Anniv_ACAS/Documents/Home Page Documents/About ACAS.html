					<p>The U.S. Army Conference on Applied Statistics (ACAS) is a forum for the presentation
and discussion of theoretical and applied papers related to the use of probability and statistics in
solving Army problems. The conference provides an invaluable opportunity for interaction
among academic, industry, and Army scientists. It also serves a nurturing role in the elevation of
statistical competence among Army researchers in other disciplines who find themselves
statistical practitioners because of the compelling benefits statistical science brings to Army
research, development, and testing.</p>

<p>The conference is structured as follows. General sessions offer invited presentations on
emerging topics in statistics. Special sessions focus attention on Army problem areas in which
the role of statistical science can be more fully explored. Contributed sessions include papers
ranging from new methodology to interesting statistical application. In the clinical sessions, a
distinct feature of the conference, presenters can seek guidance from a panel of experts for
problems that have not been completely or satisfactorily solved. Army context is strongly
encouraged as the motivation or as a potential application for all work presented, but the focus
is to be statistics.</p>
<p>Two other important events take place at the conference. A tutorial on a statistical topic
believed to be important in Army application precedes each conference. The Army Wilks Award
is given periodically at this conference to an individual who has made significant contributions to
the practice of statistical science in the Army through research in statistics and application of
statistics in the solution of Army problems.</p>
<p>ACAS was established in 1995 by six sponsoring activities: the U.S. Army Research
Laboratory, the U.S. Army Research Office, the U.S. Military Academy, the Walter Reed Army
Institute of Research, the National Institute of Standards and Technology, and TRADOC
Analysis Center-White Sands Missile Range. The U.S. Army Research Laboratory takes the lead
role in administering the conference, with support provided from numerous personnel in these
organizations and others across the Army and academia. ACAS is the successor to the
Conference on the Design of Experiments in Army Research, Development, and Testing, a
historic series of meetings that formally concluded in 1994 after 40 years of service to the Army.</p>
