  <title>U.S. Army Conference on Applied Statistics - Site</title></head>
<body bgcolor="#ffffff">
<p align="center"><b><font color="#09521f" size="+3">Annapolis, Maryland</font></b></p>
<p>The conference is being held at the O'Callaghan Annapolis Hotel from
19-21 October, with a two-day tutorial on Logistic Regression preceding
on 17-18 October. The tutorial will also be held in the O'Callaghan.
This is the first visit of the conference to historic Annapolis, MD,
and its proximity to Washington, D.C. and the vast DoD enterprise in
the region makes us optimistic about the meeting planned for this year.</p>
		<p>Annapolis,
briefly our nation's capital, played an important role in our colonial
history. The O'Callaghan has convenient parking, is within easy walking
distance of St. Johns College, the Naval Academy, the State House, and
the Annapolis waterfront and shops.To learn more about the Annapolis area and sightseeing opportunities, we suggest checking <a href="http://www.visitannapolis.org/index.aspx">Visit Annapolis</a>.&nbsp; </p>
