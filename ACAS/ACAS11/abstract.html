Abstract
to ACAS</font></b></p>
<p><font size="+2">Instructions</font></p>
<p>Abstracts may be submitted for consideration in a
contributed/technical
or clinical session. Descriptions of both session types are given
below.
Each submission should contain the following information.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>1. Title of paper and short abstract written in standard ASCII
text.</p>
  <p>2. Name of author(s) and exact title of the organization(s).</p>
  <p>3. Type of paper (technical or clinical).</p>
  <p>4. Equipment needed (overhead, slide projector, etc.).</p>
  <p>5. Telephone number of the author (DSN or commercial).</p>
  <p>6. E-mail address of the author(s).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Submissions should arrive by September 9th to:</p>
<p><a href="mailto:Barry%20A.%20Bodt%20%3Cbabodt@arl.army.mil%3E">Barry
Bodt</a>, barry.a.bodt.civ@mail.mil. <br>
Note: MS Word attachments using standard ASCII characters are most convenient.</p>
<p>Submissions may also be mailed to:</p>

<p><font size="+2">Technical Papers</font></p>
<p>Contributed/technical papers can vary in content from new research
to
well-posed problems in which statistical methods are applied to solve
specific
Defense problems. Speakers are strongly encouraged to present their
papers
in terms of the potential or real problems that motivated the work.
Where
the solution to a problem relies on relatively recent or specialized
results
in the theory of statistics and probability, these results should be
explained
or documented in sufficient detail to permit an audience of statistical
practitioners with broadly varying backgrounds to utilize the results
to
enhance their problem solving capabilities.</p>
<p><font size="+2">Clinical Papers</font></p>
<p>A distinct feature of this conference is the Clinical Session.
Presentations feature applied statistics problems which have not been
completely or satisfactorily solved, and for which the presenter seeks
assistance in developing a satisfactory approach. A panel of experts,
composed of invited speakers and other distinguished attendees,
convenes for each clinical session to provide guidance. Authors of a
clinical paper must provide a brief description of the problem by 19
September so that the panelists have sufficient time to prepare their
recommendations. We invite you to consider this opportunity to present
an interesting statistical problem to some of the country's leading
applied and mathematical statisticians.</p>
<p><font size="+2">Presentation Time</font></p>
<p>Technical papers are nominally allowed 30 minutes, to include 5
minutes
at the end for audience discussion and questions. Of the 40 minutes
available
for clinical papers, approximately 15 minutes are recommended for the
problem
statement, allowing 25 minutes for panel discussion. Invited
presentations
are 45 minutes.</p>
