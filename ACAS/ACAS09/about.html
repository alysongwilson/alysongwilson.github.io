<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The U.S. Army Conference on Applied Statistics
(ACAS) is a forum for the presentation and discussion of theoretical and
applied papers related to the use of probability and statistics in solving
defense problems. The conference provides an invaluable opportunity for
interaction among academic, industry, and defense scientists. It also serves
a nurturing role in the elevation of statistical competence among defense
researchers in other disciplines who find themselves statistical practitioners
because of the compelling benefits statistical science brings to defense
research, development, and testing. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The conference is structured as follows. General
sessions offer invited presentations on emerging topics in statistics. Special
sessions focus attention on Army problem areas in which the role of statistical
science can be more fully explored. Contributed sessions include papers
ranging from new methodology to interesting statistical application. In
the clinical sessions, a distinct feature of the conference, presenters
can seek guidance from a panel of experts for problems that have not been
completely or satisfactorily solved. <I>Defense and security context</I>
<I>is strongly encouraged as the motivation or as a potential application
for all work presented, but the focus is to be statistics. </I></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Two other important events take place at the conference.
A tutorial on a statistical topic believed to be important in defense application
precedes each conference. The Army Wilks Award is given periodically at
this conference to an individual who has made significant contributions
to the practice of statistical science in the Army through research in statistics
and application of statistics in the solution of Army problems.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">ACAS was established in 1995 by six sponsoring
activities: the </FONT>U.S. Army Research Laboratory<FONT COLOR="#000000">,
the U.S. Army Research Office, the U.S. Military Academy, the Walter Reed
Army Institute of Research, the National Institute of Standards and Technology,
and TRADOC Analysis Center-White Sands Missile Range. The </FONT>U.S. Army
Research Laboratory <FONT COLOR="#000000">took the lead role in administering
the conference, with support provided from numerous personnel in these organizations
and others across the Army and academia. In 2005, ACAS became a conference
of the Interface Foundation of North America, a move intended to provide
greater autonomy and reach for the meeting. ACAS is the successor to the
</FONT><A HREF="history.html">Conference on the Design of Experiments</A><FONT
 COLOR="#000000"> in Army Research, Development, and Testing, a historic
series of meetings that formally concluded in 1994 after 40 years of service
to the Army.</FONT></P>
