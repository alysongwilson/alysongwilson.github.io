		<p><b>About R:</b></p>
		<p>R is an open-source, extensible integrated suite of software facilities for data manipulation, calculation and graphical display, similar to S. R provides a wide variety of statistical techniques including linear and nonlinear modeling, classical statistical tests, time-series analysis, classification, and clustering. Furthermore, it is known for the well-designed publication-quality plots, including mathematical symbols and formulae where needed, that can be produced with ease and under total user control. R is available as Free Software under the terms of the Free Software Foundation's GNU General Public License in source code form. It compiles and runs on a wide variety of UNIX platforms and similar systems (including FreeBSD and Linux), Windows and MacOS. Attendees will add a valuable tool to their professional skill set, as hands-on opportunities will allow them to experience many of the features and capabilities of the R language and environment.<br>
