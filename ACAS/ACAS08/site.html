  <title>U.S. Army Conference on Applied Statistics - Site</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#ffffff">
<p align="center"><b><font color="#09521f" size="+3">Lexington, Virginia</font></b></p>
<p>The conference will be held on the campus of the Virginia Military Institute from 22-24 October with a two-day tutorial preceding on 20-21 October. The tutorial will also be held on campus. To learn more about the Lexington area and siteseeing opportunities, we suggest checking the <a
 href="http://www.lexingtonvirginia.com/">visitor's bureau</a><a
 href="http://www.visithoustontexas.com/"></a> for Lexington. </p>
		<p>Fall foliage should be moderate to high by conference time. The entrance to the Blue Ridge Parkway is only 10 miles east of Lexington at Buena Vista, VA. Traveling north, The Blue Ridge Parkway becomes Skyline Drive as it crosses I64 and enters Virginia's Shenandoah National Park. </p>
		<p>This is the first time the conference has been held in Lexington. We are confident that it will be a great venue. </p>
