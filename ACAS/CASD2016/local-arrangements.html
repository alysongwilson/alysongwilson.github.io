					<h1>Local Arrangements</h1>
					<h3>Washington, DC</h3>
<p>The conference and preceding short course will take place at the Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2 Massachusetts Ave NE, Washington, DC. The meeting rooms are in the Janet Norwood Conference and Training Center. Directions to the BLS can be found here: <a href="http://www.bls.gov/bls/directions.htm">http://www.bls.gov/bls/directions.htm</a>. <em>Note that the visitor’s entrance is on 1st Street</em>.</p>

<p>When you arrive at BLS, let the guard know that you are with CASD for entry into the facility. <em>A valid picture ID is required</em>. Once you go through the scanner, head straight and go past the escalator, where you will find the elevators to your left. Go down to Level G. You will see the entrance to the conference center – to your left – after you leave the elevator area. Go past the receptionist into the conference center. Registration tables will be straight ahead in the large open area.</p>

<p>If you are planning to register on site, please ask the guards to contact the receptionist in the conference center, with Wendy Martinez, a BLS employee and local POC (202-691-7400 or 540-645-7525), as a backup.</p>

<p>We will have coffee, tea, donuts, and bagels available in the morning and soda and water for the afternoon break. Lunch will be on your own, but there is a large food court across the street in Union Station and a small cafeteria on-site at BLS.</p>

					<p>The Red Line <a href="http://www.wmata.com/">Metro</a> passes through Union Station, which is across the street from BLS. People taking the <a href="http://www.vre.org/">VRE</a> (Northern Virginia), <a href="http://mta.maryland.gov/marc-train/">MARC</a> (Southern Maryland) or <a href="http://www.amtrak.com">Amtrak</a> (elsewhere) trains will come to Union Station, so rail travel would be a convenient way to come to the meeting. The Blue Line subway services Reagan Washington National Airport and from Blue, one can transfer to the Red Line subway.</p>

<p>Street parking is available near the BLS Postal Square Building and all-day paid parking is available at Union Station, located next to the BLS.</p>

<p>The greater DC area is serviced by <a href="http://www.bwiairport.com">Baltimore/Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport</a>, <a href="http://www.mwaa.com">Dulles International</a>, and <a href="http://www.mwaa.com">Ronald Reagan Washington National</a> airports. <a href="https://www.bls.gov/bls/directions.htm">BLS is next to Union Station</a>. Other helpful information regarding travel to DC can be linked to through the <a href="http://washington.org/">Visitor’s Bureau</a>.</p>

					<p>There is no conference hotel for this meeting.</p>
