		<p align="center">Prof. William Q. Meeker, Iowa State University<br></p>Reliability
improvement and reliability assurance processes in manufacturing
industries require data-driven reliability information for making
business, product-design, and engineering decisions. This will be a
hands-on workshop where participants will use the JMP 11 software for
analyzing reliability data and test planning. The course will focus on
concepts, examples, models, data analysis, and interpretation. Examples
and exercises will include examples using product field (maintenance or
warranty) data, accelerated life tests, and accelerated degradation
tests. After completing this course, participants will be able to
recognize and properly deal with different kinds of reliability data
and properly interpret important reliability metrics. Topics will
include the use of probability plots to identify appropriate
distributional models (e.g. Weibull and lognormal distributions),
estimating important quantities like distribution quantiles and failure
probabilities, the analysis of data with multiple failure modes, the
analysis of both destructive and repeated measures degradation data, and
the analysis of recurrence data from a fleet of systems or a
reliability growth program.<br>
