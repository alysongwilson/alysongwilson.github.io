<p>CASD is being held at the the Bureau of Labor Statistics in
Washington DC 20-24 October, with a two-day tutorial
"Statistical Methods for Product Life Analysis and Accelerated Testing"
on 20-21 October. The
tutorial will also be held in the BLS facilities. The conference has
visited the Washington DC area several times in its history, beginning
with the inaugural conference in 1955 at the Diamond Ordnance Fuze
Laboratories (now part of the Army Research Laboratory) in Adelphi MD
and just last year at the American Statistical Association in
Alexandria, VA. The DC area offers many advantages for our attendees.<br>
</p>

<p>The Bureau of Labor Statistics is in the Postal Square Building at 2
Massachusetts Ave., N.E. Washington, DC.&nbsp;More information about
Alexandria, including
hotels and restaurants can be found through the <a href="http://washington.org/">Visitor's Bureau</a> site.<br>
