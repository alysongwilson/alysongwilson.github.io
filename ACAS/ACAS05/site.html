<P>The conference will be held at the<A HREF="http://www.nps.navy.mil/">
Naval Postgraduate School</A>, from 19-21 October 2005 with a two-day tutorial
preceding on 17-18 October. A new site describing <A HREF="http://www.nps.edu/">NPS</A>
is also available. To learn more about the Monterey area, we suggest the
site <A HREF="http://monterey.com/">monterey.com</A>.</P>

<P>Monterey has been a favorite destination for the ACAS and the DOE before
it. Our last visit was in 1996, when as part of the conference we celebrated
40 years of experimentation at Fort Hunter Liggett. Over the years we were
frequently guests of Ft. Ord and we are excited to return to Monterey as
the guest of NPS and TRAC-Monterey.</P>

<P>This is a very popular destination, so be sure to make reservations in
a timely manner.</P>
