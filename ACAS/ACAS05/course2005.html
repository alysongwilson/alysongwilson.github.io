R</FONT></B></P>

<P><B>Abstract:</B></P>

<P>Mixed-effects models are used in the analysis of data that have multiple
levels of variation in the response.  Common examples of such data are longitudinal
data, where there are multiple measurements gathered over time on a set
of subjects or other experimental units, and organizational data, where
the subjects are grouped into one or more levels of organizational units,
such as squad, platoon and company. Linear mixed models, which are also
called variance components models, or random slopes models or panel-data
models, have been used extensively in the analysis of such data and recently
methods have been developed for extensions such as generalized linear mixed
models and nonlinear mixed models.</P>

<P>In an STTR project for the U.S. Army Medical Research Activity we have
developed new computational methods for such models and provided an implementation
in R (www.r-project.org), a freely-available environment for statistical
computing and graphics.  In this tutorial we will introduce the data handling
and graphics capabilities of R and describe the theory and practice of the
analysis of longitudinal and organizational data using R.<BR>
