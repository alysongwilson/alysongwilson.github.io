  <UL>
    <LI>The government per diem for Monterey is $103 lodging / $64 meals. Hotel
    and sales taxes are reimbursed above the lodging per diem. These per diem
    allowance rates are set each year at the beginning of the fiscal year.
    If lodging rates are adjusted upward, so too will our room cost. However,
    the initial move by GSA is to reduce the lodging per diem while raising
    the meals per diem. We have a revised contract reflecting that change for
    all who register under ACAS, regardless of when you register. It is possible
    that GSA will reverse its decision, but right now this is a bargain. Note
    The hotel is charging an additional $10/night for calls, water, and a food
    credit.
