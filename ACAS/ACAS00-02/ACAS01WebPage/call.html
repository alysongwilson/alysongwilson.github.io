SUBJECT: U.S. Army Conference on Applied Statistics</P>

<P>Dear Colleague,</P>

<P>The Executive Board of the U.S. Army Conference on Applied Statistics
is pleased to announce that the Los Alamos National Laboratory will host
its seventh annual conference in Santa Fe, New Mexico on October 24-26,
2001.</P>

<P>The U.S. Army Conference on Applied Statistics is a forum for the presentation
of theoretical and applied papers relating to the use of probability and
statistics in solving Army problems. Today's Army faces far-ranging challenges
that encompass many topics in which probability and statistics can contribute.
The development and advancement of Army systems draw upon many techniques,
such as data mining, simulation, image analysis, linear and nonlinear modeling,
data fusion, survival analysis, and experimental design. It is the Board's
intent that conference attendees include scientists ranging from statisticians
with research interests to practitioners in other disciplines involved in
the collection and interpretation of data.</P>

<P>A short course entitled &quot;Applied Logistic Regression,&quot; taught
by David W. Hosmer of the University of Massachusetts, will precede the
conference on October 22 &amp; 23. Used primarily for modeling the relationship
between a binomial response and a set of covariates, logistic regression
has advanced dramatically over the last three decades and has become the
standard method of analysis in many fields, especially the health sciences.
These developments are discussed in Professor Hosmer's classic text <I>Applied
Logistic Regression</I>, co-authored by Stanley Lemeshow and released in
its second edition just last year. The course will be based upon selected
material from the textbook and will cover the fundamentals of logistic regression
modeling and analysis for dichotomous, polytomous, and ordinal scaled outcomes.
Topics to be covered will include model formulation, parameter estimation,
estimation and interpretation of odds-ratios and probabilities, model building
strategies, assessment of goodness-of-fit, and presentation and interpretation
of results.</P>

<P>The conference program will consist of invited talks by prominent investigators
in various branches of statistics and applied probability as well as contributed
papers of a technical, applied, or clinical nature. To date, the following
distinguished researchers have been confirmed for invited presentations:
David W. Scott (Rice; keynote address), Leo Breiman (UC Berkeley), W. Jay
Conover (Texas Tech), Bradley Efron (Stanford), William Q. Meeker (Iowa
State), Adrian E. Raftery (Washington), J&uuml;rgen Symanzik (Utah State)
and Bin Yu (UC Berkeley).</P>

<P>Three special sessions will highlight this year's conference. <B>Information
Assurance/Network Security, </B>organized by Edward Wegman (George Mason
University), will explore the increasingly important field of fraud and
intrusion detection. Gene Dutoit (U.S. Army Infantry School) and Paul Deason
(U.S.A. Training and Doctrine Command) will coordinate a session on <B>Urban
Warfare,</B> focusing on the latest advances in detailed depiction of terrain
and its impact on wargaming simulation. <B>Expert Elicitation, </B>organized
by Alyson Wilson (Los Alamos National Laboratory), will discuss and demonstrate,
using a case study, the elicitation of expertise and expert judgment to
support decision making.</P>

<P>The technical sessions of the conference will also feature contributed
papers by Army, academic, and industrial scientists, including investigators
under contract to the Army. Contributed papers can vary in content from
new research to well-posed problems in which statistical methods are applied
to solve specific Army problems. Speakers are strongly encouraged to present
their papers in terms of the potential or real problems that motivated the
work. Results that rely on relatively recent or specialized results in the
theory of statistics and probability should be explained in sufficient detail
to permit an audience of statistical practitioners with broadly varying
backgrounds to use the results to enhance their own problem-solving capabilities.</P>

<P>In the clinical sessions, a distinct element of this conference, unresolved
problems in applied statistics are accepted. A panel of experts, comprised
of invited speakers and other distinguished attendees, offers guidance on
how to proceed. Authors of a clinical paper must provide a brief description
of the problem by September 21, 2001 so that the panelists have sufficient
time to prepare their recommendations. We invite you to consider this opportunity
to present an interesting statistical problem to some of the country's leading
applied and mathematical statisticians.</P>

<P>Participation from many activities is sought to ensure a mixture of science
and application. A call for papers is hereby extended. Speakers will be
notified regarding paper acceptance no later than September 7. It may become
necessary to limit the number of papers, so a timely response is recommended.
To submit a paper for consideration, please send the following information
by August 17 to Barry A. Bodt, U.S. Army Research Laboratory, ATTN: AMSRL-CI-CT,
Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD 21005-5067. (Electronic mail sent to babodt@arl.army.mil
is preferred.)</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>1. Title of paper and a short abstract written in standard ASCII text.</P>
  <P>2. Name of author(s) and exact title of the organization(s).</P>
  <P>3. Type of paper (technical or clinical).</P>
  <P>4. Equipment needed (overhead, slide projector, etc.).</P>
  <P>5. Telephone number of the author(s) (DSN or commercial).</P>
  <P>6. E-mail address of the author(s).</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Technical papers are nominally allowed 30 minutes, to include 5 minutes
at the end for audience discussion and questions. Of the 40 minutes available
for clinical papers, approximately 15 minutes are recommended for the problem
statement, allowing 25 minutes for panel discussion.</P>

<P>The conference also marks the occasion when the Army Wilks award is presented
for significant contributions to the U.S. Army in the areas of statistical
research, applications, and/or consulting. This year the Board is accepting
open nominations for award candidates. Letters of nomination should include
the nominee's vita relevant to Army service, and should be mailed by July
13, 2001 to Jock O. Grynovicki, U.S. Army Research Laboratory, ATTN: AMSRL-HR-SE,
Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD 21005-5425.</P>

<P>All conference activities will take place at the Bishop's Lodge retreat
located just outside of Santa Fe. Secluded in its own private valley, this
four-star hideaway is recognized by <I>Travel &amp; Leisure</I> magazine
as one of the nation's top retreats. Distinguished for its Spanish Colonial
and Native American styles, Bishop's Lodge offers complete modern conveniences,
exceptional recreational opportunities, and spectacular mountain and ranch
views. A special conference rate within government per diem will be available.</P>

<P>The city of Santa Fe is situated at the base of the Rocky Mountains in
north-central New Mexico. Settled over 400 years ago, Santa Fe offers a
historic past and rich culture to explore. Its 60,000 residents give it
a small-city feel,  yet Santa Fe is also home to numerous museums, art galleries,
shops, and boutiques. Entertainment ranges from dance to theater to music,
not to mention the boundless opportunities for outdoor enthusiasts in the
surrounding 1.5 million acres of National Forest and public lands.</P>

<P>This year's conference is sponsored by the U.S. Army Research Laboratory,
the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, the TRADOC Analysis Center -
WSMR, the United States Military Academy, and the Army Research Office &shy;
with cooperation from the Los Alamos National Laboratory, the George Mason
University, the Office of Naval Research, and the Institute for Defense
Analysis. A host letter providing more detailed information regarding registration
fees, additional lodging, agenda, etc. will follow in August. Prior to this
mailing, information concerning the conference and tutorial can be obtained
via the Internet at http://rpstl.arl.army.mil/isb/acas/. Any additional
inquiries concerning the conference may be directed to Barry A. Bodt at
the address noted previously, by phone (410-278-6659), or by fax (410-278-4988).</P>

<P>Sincerely,</P>
