<P><B>Abstract:</B></P>

<P>This two-day short course will present an introduction to using the logistic
regression model. Topics to be covered will include model formulation, parameter
estimation, estimation and interpretation of odds-ratios and probabilities,
model building strategies, assessment of goodness-of-fit, and presentation
and interpretation of results. The course will consider the logistic regression
model for binary, multinomial, and ordinal scaled outcomes.</P>

<P>The course will be taught by Professor David W. Hosmer of the Biostatistics
Department of the University of Massachusetts. Prof. Hosmer has over 10
years experience teaching similar short courses to statisticians, epidemiologists,
physicians and other subject matter scientists.</P>

<P>The course will be based upon selected chapters and sections in Professor
Hosmer's recent text, <I>Applied Logistic Regression. </I>Co-authored by
Professor Stanley Lemeshow of Ohio State University, the second edition
of this widely referenced text was published in 2000 by John Wiley &amp;
Sons. Topics to be covered from this edition, with sections and page numbers
noted, appear below:</P>
