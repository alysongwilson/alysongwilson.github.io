2000<BR><BR>AMSRL-WM-BC<BR><BR>SUBJECT: U.S. Army Conference on Applied 
Statistics<BR><BR><BR><BR>Dear Colleague,<BR><BR>The Executive Board of the U.S. 
Army Conference on Applied Statistics is pleased to announce&nbsp;<BR>that Rice 
University will host its sixth annual conference in Houston, Texas on October 
18-20, 2000.&nbsp;<BR><BR>The U.S. Army Conference on Applied Statistics is a 
forum for the presentation of theoretical&nbsp;<BR>and applied papers relating 
to the use of probability and statistics in solving Army problems. 
Today's&nbsp;<BR>Army faces far-ranging challenges that encompass many topics in 
which probability and statistics can&nbsp;<BR>contribute. To name a few, data 
mining, simulation, linear and nonlinear modeling, statistical 
control,&nbsp;<BR>data fusion, survival analysis, and experimental design play 
essential roles in the development and&nbsp;<BR>advancement of Army systems. It 
is the Board's goal that conference attendees include 
scientists&nbsp;<BR>ranging from statisticians with research interests to 
practitioners in other disciplines involved in the&nbsp;<BR>collection and 
interpretation of data.<BR><BR>A short course entitled "Data, Knowledge, and 
Information Integration to Support Decision&nbsp;<BR>Making", taught by Dr. 
Sallie Keller-McNulty and staff of Los Alamos National Laboratory, will 
precede&nbsp;<BR>the conference on October 16 &amp; 17. The course will cover 
structured, quantitative approaches for&nbsp;<BR>combining data, knowledge, and 
information from multiple sources and in various forms (including 
both&nbsp;<BR>quantitative and qualitative) to support decision making. 
Techniques from various disciplines, including&nbsp;<BR>state-of-the-art expert 
elicitation, statistical and reliability analysis, and knowledge management, 
will be&nbsp;<BR>discussed and applied to develop formal methods for information 
integration. Possible DoD applications&nbsp;<BR>will be addressed.<BR><BR>The 
conference program will consist of invited talks by prominent investigators in 
various&nbsp;<BR>branches of statistics and applied probability as well as 
contributed papers of a technical, applied, or&nbsp;<BR>clinical nature. To 
date, the following distinguished researchers have been confirmed for 
invited&nbsp;<BR>presentations: J. Stuart Hunter (Princeton; keynote address), 
Alan Agresti (Florida), Donald A. Berry&nbsp;<BR>(Duke), Noel A. C. Cressie 
(Ohio State), Stuart A. Geman (Brown), Naomi Oreskes (UC San Diego), 
and&nbsp;<BR>Emanuel Parzen (Texas A&amp;M).<BR><BR>Three special sessions will 
highlight this year's conference: 1) Biological Warfare, organized&nbsp;<BR>by 
Marek Kimmel of Rice University. In this session, statistical questions will be 
examined in the context&nbsp;<BR>of biological warfare; for example, the 
population impact of an accidental epidemic and the accuracy of&nbsp;<BR>impact 
predictions. 2) Digital Government, organized by Edward Wegman of George 
Mason&nbsp;<BR>University. The basic premise and structure of the Digital 
Government initiative will be the focus of this&nbsp;<BR>session, along with 
discussions on security issues and information warfare. 3) Reliability, 
organized by&nbsp;<BR>Arthur Fries of the Institute for Defense Analysis. 
Highlights of the June 2000 National Research Council&nbsp;<BR>"Workshop on 
Reliability Issues of DoD Systems" will be shared in this session.<BR><BR>The 
technical session of the conference will also feature contributed papers by Army 
scientists,&nbsp;<BR>and academic and industrial scientists, including 
investigators under contract to the Army. Contributed&nbsp;<BR>papers can vary 
in content from new research to well-posed problems in which statistical methods 
are&nbsp;<BR>applied to solve specific Army problems. Speakers are strongly 
encouraged to present their papers in&nbsp;<BR>terms of the potential or real 
problems that motivated the work. Results that rely on relatively recent 
or&nbsp;<BR>specialized results in the theory of statistics and probability 
should be explained in sufficient detail to&nbsp;<BR>permit an audience of 
statistical practitioners with broadly varying backgrounds to use the results 
to&nbsp;<BR>enhance their own problem-solving capabilities.<BR><BR>A distinct 
element of this conference is its Clinical Sessions. Presentations in these 
sessions&nbsp;<BR>feature applied statistics problems which have not been 
completely or satisfactorily solved, and for which&nbsp;<BR>the presenter seeks 
assistance in developing a satisfactory approach. A panel of experts, composed 
of&nbsp;<BR>invited speakers and other distinguished attendees, is convened for 
each clinical session for the purpose&nbsp;<BR>of providing guidance. Authors of 
a clinical paper must provide a brief description of the problem 
by&nbsp;<BR>September 22, 2000 in order that the panelists have sufficient time 
to prepare their recommendations.&nbsp;<BR>We invite you to consider this 
opportunity to present a bothersome statistical problem to some of 
the&nbsp;<BR>country's leading applied and mathematical 
statisticians.<BR><BR>Participation from many activities is sought to ensure a 
mixture of science and application. A&nbsp;<BR>call for papers is hereby 
extended. Speakers will be notified regarding paper acceptance no later 
than&nbsp;<BR>September 8. It may become necessary to limit the number of 
papers, so a timely response is&nbsp;<BR>recommended. To submit a paper for 
consideration, please send the following information by August 18&nbsp;<BR>to 
Barry A. Bodt, U.S. Army Research Laboratory, ATTN: AMSRL-CI-CD, Aberdeen 
Proving Ground, MD&nbsp;<BR>21005-5067. (Electronic mail sent to 
babodt@arl.army.mil is preferred.)&nbsp;<BR><BR>1. Title of paper, and a short 
abstract written in standard ASCII text.<BR>2. Name of author(s) and exact title 
of the organization(s).<BR>3. Type of paper (technical or clinical).<BR>4. 
Equipment needed (overhead, slide projector, etc.).<BR>5. Telephone number of 
the author(s) (DSN or commercial).<BR>6. E-mail address of the 
author(s).<BR><BR>Clinical and technical papers are nominally 30 minutes and 20 
minutes, respectively. Of the 30&nbsp;<BR>minutes available for clinical papers, 
approximately 10 minutes are recommended for the problem&nbsp;<BR>statement, 
allowing 20 minutes for panel discussion. The agenda will be structured to 
provide some&nbsp;<BR>discussion time between papers.<BR><BR>The conference also 
marks the occasion when the Army Wilks award is presented for 
significant&nbsp;<BR>contributions to the U.S. Army in the areas of statistical 
research, applications, and/or consulting. This&nbsp;<BR>year the Board is 
accepting open nominations for award candidates. Letters of nomination 
should&nbsp;<BR>include the nominee's vita relevant to Army service, and should 
be mailed by July 14, 2000 to Jock O.&nbsp;<BR>Grynovicki, U.S. Army Research 
Laboratory, ATTN: AMSRL-HR-IS, Aberdeen Proving Ground, 
MD&nbsp;<BR>21005-5425.<BR><BR>The campus of Rice University is centrally 
located in Houston, Texas, the fourth largest city in&nbsp;<BR>the nation. 
Houston offers a tremendous variety of activities and attractions for visitors. 
The area's top&nbsp;<BR>tourist attraction is the Houston Space Center, a museum 
celebrating the accomplishments of NASA and&nbsp;<BR>the American manned space 
flight program. Other nearby attractions include the Houston Museum 
of&nbsp;<BR>Natural Science, the Houston Zoo, the nearby Rice Village Shopping 
Center, and several art galleries&nbsp;<BR>and museums. Performing arts 
attractions include the Houston Symphony, the Houston Grand Opera,&nbsp;<BR>and 
numerous venues for all musical tastes including regional blues, county-western, 
and Tejano.&nbsp;<BR>Sports fans can catch the excitement of Houston Rockets NBA 
basketball, NCAA football at any of&nbsp;<BR>several local universities, or 
racing at Gulf Greyhound Park. Houston's culinary landmarks include 
its&nbsp;<BR>steakhouses, Cajun crab shacks, Tex-Mex taquerias and barbecue 
joints, but the diversity of its&nbsp;<BR>population has also spawned a wealth 
of fine ethnic restaurants.<BR><BR>This year's conference is sponsored by the 
U.S. Army Research Laboratory, Walter Reed Army&nbsp;<BR>Institute of Research, 
United States Military Academy, TRADOC Analysis Center - WSMR, 
Army&nbsp;<BR>Research Office, and National Institute for Standards and 
Technology - with cooperation from Los&nbsp;<BR>Alamos National Laboratory, 
RAND, George Mason University, Rice University, Office of 
Naval&nbsp;<BR>Research, and Institute for Defense Analysis. Conference meetings 
will convene in the newly&nbsp;<BR>constructed Duncan Hall on the Rice campus, 
and a block of rooms has been reserved at the nearby&nbsp;<BR>Crowne Plaza 
Hotel, Houston Medical Center. A host letter providing more detailed 
information&nbsp;<BR>regarding registration fees, additional lodging, agenda, 
etc. will follow in August. Prior to this mailing,&nbsp;<BR>information
