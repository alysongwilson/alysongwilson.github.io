INTEGRATION TO SUPPORT DECISION MAKING</FONT></P>
<P align=center><FONT size=+1>Statistics Group<BR>Los Alamos National 
Laboratory<BR></FONT>October 16 -17</P>
<P><B>Abstract:</B></P>
<P>This course will cover structured, quantitative approaches for combining 
data, knowledge, and information from multiple sources and in various forms 
(including both quantitative and qualitative) to support decision making. 
Techniques from various disciplines, including state-of-the-art expert 
elicitation, statistical and reliability analysis, and knowledge management, 
will be discussed and applied to develop formal methods for information 
integration. Possible DoD applications will be addressed.</P>
