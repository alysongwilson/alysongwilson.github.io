<P>ACAS is the successor to the Conference on the Design of Experiments in Army 
Research, Development, and Testing. Professor Samuel S. Wilks, of Princeton 
University, proposed the formation of a conference focusing on the design of 
experiments in Army research, development and testing after a survey by the Army 
Mathematics Steering Committee found that Army scientists in over thirty Army 
facilities perceived a need in this area. Wilks, a member of that committee, 
proposed the idea to COL Leslie E. Simon (later to become Major General) who was 
Assistant Chief of Ordnance for Research and Development, U.S. Army and a 
personal friend of Wilks. Months later, on 19-21 October, 1955 the first 
conference was held at the Diamond Ordnance Fuze Laboratories (now part of the 
Army Research Laboratory) and the National Bureau of Standards with organization 
responsibility falling to the Office of Ordnance Research (now the Army Research 
Office). Wilks chaired the conference each year until his death in 1964. The 
conference formally concluded in 1994.</P>
<P>ACAS is an attempt to continue the traditions of the Design of Experiments 
Conference while broadening the statistical scope with a more aggressive pursuit 
of emerging methodologies. Today's Army faces challenges that are far ranging 
and encompass many topics in which probability and statistics have a 
contribution to make, in addition to experimental design.</P>
