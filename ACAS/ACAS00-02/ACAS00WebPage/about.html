ACAS</FONT></STRONG></B></P>
<P><FONT color=#000000>The U.S. Army Conference on Applied Statistics (ACAS) is 
a forum for the presentation and discussion of theoretical and applied papers 
related to the use of probability and statistics in solving Army problems. The 
conference provides an invaluable opportunity for interaction among academic, 
industry, and Army scientists. It also serves a nurturing role in the elevation 
of statistical competence among Army researchers in other disciplines who find 
themselves statistical practitioners because of the compelling benefits 
statistical science brings to Army research, development, and testing. 
</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#000000>The conference is structured as follows. General sessions 
offer invited presentations on emerging topics in statistics. Special sessions 
focus attention on Army problem areas in which the role of statistical science 
can be more fully explored. Contributed sessions include papers ranging from new 
methodology to interesting statistical application. Clinical sessions, a 
distinct feature of the conference, accept problems which have not been 
completely or satisfactorily solved for which the presenter seeks guidance from 
a panel of experts in developing a satisfactory approach. <I>Army context</I> 
<I>is strongly encouraged as the motivation or as a potential application for 
all work presented, but the focus is to be statistics. </I></FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#000000>Two other important events take place at the conference. 
A tutorial on a statistical topic believed to be important in Army application 
precedes each conference. The Army Wilks Award is given periodically at this 
conference to an individual who has made significant contributions to the 
practice of statistical science in the Army through their research in statistics 
and their application of statistics in the solution of Army problems.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#000000>ACAS was established in 1995 by six sponsoring 
activities: </FONT>U.S. Army Research Laboratory<FONT color=#000000>, U.S. Army 
Research Office, U.S. Military Academy, Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, 
National Institute of Standards and Technology, TRADOC Analysis Center-White 
Sands Missile Range. The </FONT><A href="http://www.arl.mil/">U.S. Army Research 
Laboratory</A><FONT color=#000000> takes the lead role in administering the 
conference with support provided from numerous personnel in these organizations 
and others across the Army and academia. ACAS is the successor to the </FONT><A 
href="history.html">Conference on the Design 
of Experiments</A><FONT color=#000000> in Army Research, Development, and 
Testing, a historic series of meetings that formally concluded in 1994 after 40 
years of service to the Army.</FONT></P>
