ACAS</FONT></B></P>
<P><FONT size=+2>Instructions</FONT></P>
<P>Abstracts may be submitted for consideration in a contributed or clinical 
session. Descriptions of both session types are given below. Each submission 
should contain the following information.</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>1. Title of paper and short abstract.</P>
  <P>2. Name of author(s) and exact title of the organization.</P>
  <P>3. Type of paper (technical or clinical).</P>
  <P>4. Equipment needed (overhead, slide projector, etc.).</P>
  <P>5. Telephone number of the author (DSN or commercial).</P>
  <P>6. E-mail address of the author.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Submissions should arrive by 20 August to:</P>
<P>U.S. Army Research Laboratory<BR>ATTN: AMSRL-IS-CD (Dr. Bodt)<BR>APG, MD 
21005-5067</P>
<P>Submissions may also be e-mailed as an attachment to <A 
href="mailto:Barry%20A.%20Bodt%20<babodt@arl.mil>">Barry Bodt</A>, 
babodt@arl.mil. Note: MS Word attachments are most convenient.</P>
<P><FONT size=+2>Technical Papers</FONT></P>
<P>Contributed/technical papers can vary in content from new research to 
well-posed problems in which statistical methods are applied to solve specific 
Army problems. Speakers are strongly encouraged to present their papers in terms 
of the potential or real problems that motivated the work. Where the solution to 
a problem relies on relatively recent or specialized results in the theory of 
statistics and probability, these results should be explained or documented in 
sufficient detail to permit an audience of statistical practitioners with 
broadly varying backgrounds to utilize the results to enhance their problem 
solving capabilities.</P>
<P><FONT size=+2>Clinical Papers</FONT></P>
<P>A distinct feature of this conference is the Clinical Session(s). These 
presentations feature applied statistics problems which have not been completely 
or satisfactorily solved, and for which the presenter seeks assistance in 
developing a satisfactory approach. A panel of experts, composed of invited 
speakers and other distinguished attendees, is convened for each clinical 
session for the purpose of providing guidance. Authors of a clinical paper must 
provide a brief description of the problem by 10 September 1999 in order that 
the panelists have sufficient time to prepare their recommendations. We invite 
you to consider this opportunity to present a bothersome statistical problem to 
some of the country's leading applied and mathematical statisticians.</P>
<P><FONT size=+2>Presentation Time</FONT></P>
<P>Clinical and contributed papers are nominally 30 minutes and 20 minutes, 
respectively. Of the 30 minutes available for clinical papers, approximately 10 
minutes is recommended for the problem statement, allowing 20 minutes for panel 
discussion. The agenda will be structured to provide some discussion time 
between papers.</P>
