<P>Professor Edward J. Wegman has been named the recipient of the 1999 Army 
Wilks Memorial Award. The award, commemorating the contributions of Samuel S. 
Wilks to statistical science in the Army, is given periodically to an individual 
who has contributed greatly to the theory and practice of statistics in Army 
research, development, and testing. Wegman was recognized "for fundamental work 
in mathematical and computational statistics, for conceptual innovation which 
has changed the direction and character of statistical research, for innovative 
problem solving in applied settings, and for continuing support of Army 
statisticians and scientists."</P>
<P>The plaque and honorarium were presented by the previous winner, Robert L. 
Launer of the Army Research Office, at a ceremony during the Army Conference on 
Applied Statistics, held at the United States Military Academy, West Point, New 
York.</P>
<P>Wegman is the Chair of the Department of Applied and Engineering Statistics 
and the Director of the Center for Computational Statistics at George Mason 
University.<BR></P>
