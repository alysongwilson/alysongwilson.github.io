<P align=center><FONT size=+1>ABSTRACT</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=+1>Abstract text begins here. The abstract should be brief (150 
words or less) but informative, describing the work that was accomplished, how 
and why it was done, and the results of the work.</FONT></P>

font, preferably Times Roman, and limited to approximately 10 pages. The top, 
side, and bottom margins are 1 inch and must not be exceeded.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT size=+1>The report text begins here. Paragraph indentation is five 
spaces from the left margin and the right margin is justified. No classification 
markings are to be used on completely unclassified papers. <B>All papers in this 
conference are completely unclassified, approved for public release.</B> Double 
space between paragraphs and before and after first- and second-level headings. 
Do not number any headings.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT size=+1>Do not begin a new page for each section. Include only 
essential <B>illustrations </B>and <B>tables.</B> The legibility of the

illustration callouts in text as large as the general manuscript type. Number 
illustrations consecutively.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=+1>Cite all <B>illustrations</B> in the text. It is preferred that 
you place them as close as possible to their first mention in the text; however, 
you may choose to put them at the end of the paper. Illustrations must remain 
within the 1-inch margins. Figures in half tone are preferred. High-quality 
black and white glossy photographs are acceptable. A Xeroxed copy of a picture 
will not reproduce well when the document is printed. The figure caption will be 
centered under the figure. Captions should be type single spaced.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=+1>Cite all <B>tables </B>in the text. It is preferred that you 
place them as close as possible to their first mention in the text; however, you 
may choose to put the tables, followed by figures, at the end of the paper. Care 
should be taken that a table does not overlap onto the next page. Table captions 
should be centered above the table and have the first letters of all main word 
in capitals. Captions should be typed single spaced.</FONT></P>
<P><B><FONT size=+1>Footnotes </FONT></B><FONT size=+1>should be typed in a font 
smaller than that used for the normal text above the bottom 1-inch margin. A 
dividing line should be used to separate text from the footnote(s).</FONT></P>

capitalized and centered above the citation.</FONT></P>
<P align=center><FONT size=+1>REFERENCES</FONT></P>
<P><B><FONT size=+1>References </FONT></B><FONT size=+1>in the text will be 
numbered consecutively by superscripts. The references will be collected at the 
end of the text. The author of the journal article, the title of the journal 
article, the title of the journal in which is appears, the volume number, the 
first page, and the year should follow, in that order. Books should be cited 
similarly and include the publisher's location and name along with the year.
