<P>The conference will be held at <A href="http://www.rice.edu/">Rice 
University</A>, 18-20 October with a two-day tutorial preceding on 16-17. The 
campus of Rice University is centrally located in Houston, Texas, the fourth 
largest city in the nation. Houston offers a tremendous variety of activities 
and attractions for visitors. The area's top tourist attraction is the Houston 
Space Center, a museum celebrating the accomplishments of NASA and the American 
manned space flight program. Other nearby attractions include the Houston Museum 
of Natural Science, the Houston Zoo, the nearby Rice Village Shopping Center, 
and several art galleries and museums. Performing arts attractions include the 
Houston Symphony, the Houston Grand Opera, and numerous venues for all musical 
tastes including regional blues, county-western, and Tejano. Sports fans can 
catch the excitement of NCAA football at any of several local universities, or 
racing at Gulf Greyhound Park. Houston's culinary landmarks include its 
steakhouses, Cajun crab shacks, Tex-Mex taquerias and barbecue joints, but the 
diversity of its population has also spawned a wealth of fine ethnic 
restaurants.</P>
