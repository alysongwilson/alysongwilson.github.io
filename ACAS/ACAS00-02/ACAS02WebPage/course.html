<P>Overview: Used to extract knowledge hidden from large volumes of raw
data, data mining has been applied in recent years to a wide variety of
research areas such as medical imaging, high-energy physics, consumer behavior,
atmospheric sciences, and security and surveillance.  Data mining is an
extension of exploratory data analysis and has basically the same goals,
the discovery of unknown and unanticipated structure in the data. The chief
distinction between the two topics resides in the size and dimensionality
of the data sets involved. Data mining in general deals with much more massive
data sets for which highly interactive analysis is not fully feasible. In
this course we shall discuss the scales of data set sizes and the limits
of feasibility for the various data set sizes. We will introduce some visualization
tools and indicate how they may be used to accomplish data mining tasks.
We shall review some structure finding algorithms including: density estimation
and bump hunting; clustering and classification; visual clustering strategies;
CART and related methods; time domain time series methods; nonparametric
regression including convolution, LOESS and ridges and skeletons methods
will be illustrated with application to several data sets. Particular emphasis
will be placed on visualization techniques. The course will cover basic
techniques used in visual data mining, including parallel coordinates, grand
tour, and saturation brushing.  These techniques will be illustrated in
further discussions on rapid data editing, density estimation, inverse regression,
tree-structured decision rules, classification and clustering, structural
inference and outlier investigation.<BR>
