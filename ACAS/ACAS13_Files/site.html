<p>The
conference is being held at the the American Statistical Association in
Alexandria, VA from 9-13 December, with a two-day tutorial
"Classification and Regression Trees and Forests" on 9-10 December. The
tutorial will also be held in the ASA facilities. The conference has
visited the D.C. area several times in its history, especially marking
shifts in direction, going back to the Conference on the Design of
Experiments in Army Research, Development, and Testing. The inaugural
conference in 1955 was held at the Diamond Ordnance Fuze Laboratories
(now part of the U.S. Army Research Laboratory) in Adelphi, MD. Forty
years later, the conference became the Army
Conference on Applied Statistics (ACAS) under new sponsorship and with
a broadening emphasis. The Washington D.C. area was again the choice
with a return to the Army Research Laboratory headquarters in Adelphi,
MD.
It is only fitting that with another significant conference change,
that the Interface Conference on Applied Statistics (ICAS) would begin
in the Capital Region, this time in nearby Alexandria at the location
of the American Statistical Association.<br>

<p>The American Statistical Association address is 732 North Washington
