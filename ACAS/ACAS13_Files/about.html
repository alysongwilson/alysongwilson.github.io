<p align="center"><b><strong><font color="#09521f" size="+3">About ICAS</font></strong></b></p>

<p><font color="#000000">The Interface Conference on Applied Statistics
(ICAS) is a forum for the presentation and discussion of theoretical and
applied papers related to the use of probability and statistics in solving
problems of National importance. The conference provides an invaluable opportunity for
interaction among academic, industry, and government scientists. It also serves
a nurturing role in the elevation of statistical competence among
researchers in other disciplines who find themselves statistical practitioners
because of the compelling benefits statistical science brings to research, development, and testing. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">The conference is structured as follows. General
sessions offer invited presentations on emerging topics in statistics. Special
sessions focus attention on National problem areas in which the role of statistical
science can be more fully explored. Contributed sessions include papers
ranging from new methodology to interesting statistical application. In
the clinical sessions, a distinct feature of the conference, presenters
can seek guidance from a panel of experts for problems that have not been
completely or satisfactorily solved. <i>National problem context</i>
<i>is strongly encouraged as the motivation or as a potential application
for all work presented, but the focus is to be statistics. </i></font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">Two other important events take place at the
conference.
A tutorial on a statistical topic believed to be important in National
application
precedes each conference. The Army Wilks Award is given periodically at
this conference to an individual who has made substantive contributions
in the area of national defense to commemorate the service of Sam Wilks.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">ICAS, originally ACAS, was established in 1995
by six sponsoring
activities within the national defense community. In the ensuing years,
the organization has broadened its mission to include context areas of
National importance and has attracted more industry, academia, and
other government agencies. In 2013, ICAS was established to reflect the
broadening role. The present direction represents a natural progression
from being a conference under Army direction (1995-2004) to one under
the direction of the Interface (2005-2012) to one that continues under
the Interface but with an expanded role in the statistical community.
In name this is suggested by the replacement of Army with Interface.
ICAS </font><font color="#000000">is the successor to the
</font><a href="history.html">Conference on the Design of Experiments</a><font color="#000000"> in Army Research, Development, and Testing, a historic
series of meetings that formally concluded in 1994 after 40 years of service
to the Army.</font></p>
