Abstract
to ACAS</font></b></p>
<p><font size="+2">Instructions</font></p>
<p>Abstracts may be submitted for consideration in a
contributed/technical
or clinical session. Descriptions of both session types are given
below.
Each submission should contain the following information.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>1. Title of paper and short abstract in MS Word.</p>
  <p>2. Name of author(s) and exact title of the organization(s).</p>
  <p>3. Type of paper (technical or clinical).</p><p>4. Telephone number of the author (DSN or commercial).</p>
  <p>5. E-mail address of the author(s).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Submissions should arrive by November 30 to:</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Don Faxon, dfaxon@gmu.edu</span></p>
<p>Note: MS Word attachments using standard ASCII characters are most
convenient. A projector for your digital presentation will be available.</p><p><font size="+2">Technical Papers</font></p>
<p>Contributed/technical papers can vary in content from new research
to
well-posed problems in which statistical methods are applied to solve
specific problems of National importance. Speakers are strongly encouraged to present their
papers
in terms of the potential or real problems that motivated the work.
Where
the solution to a problem relies on relatively recent or specialized
results
in the theory of statistics and probability, these results should be
explained
or documented in sufficient detail to permit an audience of statistical
practitioners with broadly varying backgrounds to utilize the results
to
enhance their problem solving capabilities.</p><p><font size="+2">Presentation Time</font></p>
<p>Technical papers are nominally allowed 30 minutes, to include 5
minutes
at the end for audience discussion and questions. Of the 40 minutes
available
for clinical papers, approximately 15 minutes are recommended for the
problem
statement, allowing 25 minutes for panel discussion. Invited
presentations
are 45 minutes.</p>
