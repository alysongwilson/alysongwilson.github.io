<p>The conference will be held on the campus of Rice University from

17-19 October with a two-day

tutorial preceding on 15-16 October.

The tutorial wil also be held on campus. To learn more about the

bureau</a> for Rice.</p>

<p>We have visited Rice several times, most recently in 2000.

It is a great venue for a conference and this year's meeting with Rice

as

host promises to be a good one. </p>
