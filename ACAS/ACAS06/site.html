<P>The conference will be held at the <A HREF="http://www.radisson.com/researchtrianglenc">Radisson</A>
in Research Triangle Park, from 18-20 October 2006 with a two-day tutorial
preceding on 16-17 October held at <A HREF="http://www.niss.org/">NISS</A>.
 To learn more about the Raleigh/Durham area, we suggest the <A HREF="http://www.visitraleigh.com/index.html">visitor's</A>
bureau for Raleigh or the <A HREF="http://www.durham-nc.com/">visitor's</A>
bureau for Durham.</P>

<P>We last visited North Carolina in 2002 when NC State and ARO were hosts.
It is a great venue for a conference and this year's meeting with NISS as
host promises to be a good one. </P>
