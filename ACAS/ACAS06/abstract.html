<P><FONT SIZE=+2>Technical Papers</FONT></P>

<P>Contributed/technical papers can vary in content from new research to
well-posed problems in which statistical methods are applied to solve specific
Defense problems. Speakers are strongly encouraged to present their papers
in terms of the potential or real problems that motivated the work. Where
the solution to a problem relies on relatively recent or specialized results
in the theory of statistics and probability, these results should be explained
or documented in sufficient detail to permit an audience of statistical
practitioners with broadly varying backgrounds to utilize the results to
enhance their problem solving capabilities.</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+2>Clinical Papers</FONT></P>

<P>A distinct feature of this conference is the Clinical Session. Presentations
feature applied statistics problems which have not been completely or satisfactorily
solved, and for which the presenter seeks assistance in developing a satisfactory
approach. A panel of experts, composed of invited speakers and other distinguished
attendees, convenes for each clinical session to provide guidance. Authors
of a clinical paper must provide a brief description of the problem by 21
September so that the panelists have sufficient time to prepare their recommendations.
We invite you to consider this opportunity to present an interesting statistical
problem to some of the country's leading applied and mathematical statisticians.</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+2>Presentation Time</FONT></P>

<P>Technical papers are nominally allowed 30 minutes, to include 5 minutes
at the end for audience discussion and questions. Of the 40 minutes available
for clinical papers, approximately 15 minutes are recommended for the problem
statement, allowing 25 minutes for panel discussion. Invited presentations
are 45 minutes.</P>
