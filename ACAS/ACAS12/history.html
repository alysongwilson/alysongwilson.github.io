<p>ACAS is the successor to the Conference on the Design of Experiments
in Army Research, Development, and Testing. Professor Samuel S. Wilks, of
Princeton University, proposed the formation of a conference focusing on
the design of experiments in Army research, development, and testing after
a survey by the Army Mathematics Steering Committee found that Army scientists
in over 30 Army facilities perceived a need in this area. Wilks, a member
of that committee, proposed the idea to COL Leslie E. Simon (later to become
Major General), who was Assistant Chief of Ordnance for Research and Development,
U.S. Army, and a personal friend of Wilks. Months later, on 19-21 October,
1955, the first conference was held at the Diamond Ordnance Fuze Laboratories
(now part of the U.S. Army Research Laboratory) and the National Bureau
of Standards (now the National Institute for Standards and Technology) with
organization responsibility falling to the Office of Ordnance Research (now
the U.S. Army Research Office). Wilks chaired the conference each year until
his death in 1964. The conference formally concluded in 1994.</p>

<p>ACAS continues the traditions of the Design of Experiments
Conference, while broadening the statistical scope with a more
aggressive pursuit of emerging methodologies and expanding the
application area to all military services and generally to all defense
and security issues. Today's services face challenges that are far
ranging and encompass many topics, in addition to experimental design,
in which probability and statistics have a contribution to make.</p>

<p>The 2012 ACAS is the eighteenth in the series, marking 58 years of
meetings of statistics in defense. This year reaffirms the importance
of a broad view in statistical application. A tutorial on Statistics
for Spatio-temporal Data, and invited sessions in Simulation
Experiments and Efficient Design, Design and Analysis of Observational
Studies, and Reliability Growth anchor the program.<br>
