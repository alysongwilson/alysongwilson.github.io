		</p>Logistic
regression has become the standard method of analysis when describing
the relationship between a response variable and one or more
explanatory variables, when the response variable is discrete, taking
on two or more possible values. Logistic regression models offer
advantages both in terms of model fitting and interpretation that have
led to widespread use in a variety of fields, especially medical
studies. The focus of the course will be on the methodology and
interpretation of these models. This training will cover material from
the popular book "Applied Logistic Regression, 2nd ed." by Hosmer &amp;
Lemeshow, with additional new material from the 3rd edition currently
in writing.<br>
<br>
A complete set of notes will be provided.
