  <title>U.S. Army Conference on Applied Statistics - Site</title></head>
<body bgcolor="#ffffff">
<p align="center"><b><font color="#09521f" size="+3">Monterey, California</font></b></p>
<p>The conference is being held at the Casa Munras Hotel &amp; Spa from 24-26 October 2012, with a two-day tutorial "Statistics
for Spatio-Temporal Data" preceding
on 22-23 October. The tutorial will also be held in the Casa Munras.
The conference has a wonderful history with the Monterey region, having
been hosted there in various years by Fort Ord, TEC Monterey, and the
Naval Postgraduate School, most recently in 2005. This is the first
time for the Casa Munras, but the downtown location should prove far
more convenient for conference attendees. &nbsp;</p>
		<p>Monterey
is a very nice destination. The Casa Munras is within easy walking of
the wharf, Cannery Row and associated shopping and dining. The Monterey
Bay Aquarium is not far and of course the 17-Mile Drive, Pebble Beach,
and Carmel are close by. To learn more about the Monterey area and
sightseeing opportunities, we suggest checking the city of <a href="http://www.monterey.org/en-us/visitstay.aspx">Monterey</a> and the <a href="http://www.seemonterey.com/">Monterey Convention and Visitor's Bureau</a>.&nbsp; </p>
