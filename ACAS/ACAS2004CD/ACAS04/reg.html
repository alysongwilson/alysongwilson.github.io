<P>A detailed registration form will be available after a few more conference
details are confirmed. For planning purposes, the registration fee will
be somewhat higher this year to defray the expense of a better facility.
The registration fee will be $250.00. The banquet, continuous breaks, social,
and tutorial are included for registrants. Registration is not a' la carte.
Registration covers these services and some support for speakers.</P>
