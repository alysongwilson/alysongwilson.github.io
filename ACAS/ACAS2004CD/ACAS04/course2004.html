and Visual Analytics for Communication and Discovery</FONT></B></P>

<P><B>Abstract:</B></P>

<P>This workshop presents an introduction to quantitative visualization
that starts with the foundations of human perception and cognition, and
extends to hands on use of illustrative dynamic PC shareware. An underlying
assumption is that visualization tools can enhance and extend analysts'
capabilities by exploiting their perceptual and cognitive strengths, by
handling unnatural cognitive computations and searches, and by off-loading
distracting bookkeeping tasks. The workshop objectives are for participants
to see quantitative graphics from a broader perspective, to spot redesign
opportunities for graphics and visualization software, and to be aware of
selected developments in dynamic graphics software.</P>

<P>The workshop draws on material from an evolving scientific and statistical
visualization class that has been taught to over 300 Ph.D. students from
a variety of disciplines. The diverse examples range from packet header
data (a day in the life of the Green network at LANL), to mortality rates
and risk factors from NCI, to docking statistics for human immune systems
molecules. The communication and study of geospatially-indexed statistics
gets the most attention but topics include constructing coordinates when
familiar coordinates are not available. Shareware provided to participants
on a CD include CCmaps and CrystalVision.</P>
