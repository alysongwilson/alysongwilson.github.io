<P>The conference will be held at the <A HREF="http://www.gatechhotel.com/">Georgia
Tech Hotel and Conference Center</A>, from 20-22 October with a two-day
tutorial preceding on 18-19 October. If you are planning to see some of
the area when you arrive, be sure to check the <A HREF="http://www.atlanta.net/">Visitor's
Bureau</A>. Atlanta is certainly one of our nicest cities, and there is
much to do. Visit the Shakespeare Festival, the Fernbank Museum of Natural
History, or the Atlanta Botanical Garden. Pursue southern ghosts or tour
a cemetery tied to the Civil War. For sports enthusiasts, the baseball league
championship series should be winding up during our stay. The Braves have
won ten division crowns in a row and may again be a part of post season
competition. The Falcons are in town on the 17th to play the Chargers. These
and other activities available during your stay can be checked on the <A
HREF="http://www.atlanta.net/visitors/calendarevents.asp">calendar of events</A>.
 Of course there are a host of dining and shopping opportunities as well.
