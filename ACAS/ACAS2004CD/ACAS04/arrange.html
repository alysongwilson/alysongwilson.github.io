<P><FONT SIZE=+2>Travel to the GA Tech Hotel and Conference Center:</FONT></P>

<P>Travel to GA Tech Hotel and Conference Center is straightforward by auto,
plane, or train. <A HREF="http://www.gatechhotel.com/AboutUs/mapDirections.cfm">Directions</A>
are available on the hotel web site.</P>

<P>If flying into Atlanta, there are some options to consider from the Hartsfield-Jackson
International Airport. Taxis and a full complement of rental cars are available.
If you choose a rental car, be aware that at the hotel there is a $15/day
parking fee. A better option might be the <A HREF="http://www.theatlantalink.com/">Atlanta
Link</A>, which will provide a round trip shuttle to and from the hotel
for $32. Perhaps better still is the Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit
Authority (<A HREF="http://www.itsmarta.com/">MARTA</A>) system, which for
$1.75 one-way will take you to the Midtown MARTA Transit Station. From there,
the yellow GA Tech Trolley will take you for free directly to the hotel.
This last option will take approximately 30 minutes.</P>

<P>In and around Atlanta, the free GA Tech Trolley combined with MARTA will
allow you to travel the city.<BR>

    <LI>The government per diem for Atlanta is $112 lodging / $40 meals. Hotel
    and sales taxes are reimbursed above the lodging per diem. Note that continuous
    breaks are part of the conference package. [DoD travel regulations allow
    for 25% over the typical lodging for an area (a total of $140 in this case)
    when staying at the conference hotel.] <A HREF="http://www.dtic.mil/perdiem/faqconflodging.html">Ref:
    Per Diem, Travel and Transportation <BR>
    </A>
    <LI>A revision regarding the previous bullet is required. A memo dated
    September10, 2004 from the Defense Travel Service responding to a Federal
    Register posting on August 31 informs of a change in per diem for the Atlanta
    area. The General Services Administration decided a drastic17% reduction
    in the lodging per diem was in order for the Atlanta area. Lodging per
    diem is now $93. This unfortunately commences with the new fiscal year.
    While, apparently great savings are now possible in Atlanta area hotels,
    the meal costs have crept upward. Meals per diem rose to $43. Government
    travelers, in order to avoid out-of-pocket expense if staying at the conference
    hotel, can use the Average Expense Allowance with supervisor approval.
    See question 5 in the following. <A HREF="http://www.dtic.mil/perdiem/faqconflodging.html">Ref:
    Per Diem, Travel and Transportation</A><BR>
    
    <LI>The GA Tech Hotel and Conference Planning Department will attempt to
    assist us if we surpass our room block by securing alternative lodging.
    Conference details will be handled by Victor Stegall at 404-838-2116. Additional
    hotels in the immediate area may be accessed through the <A HREF="http://www.atlanta.net/visitors/accommodations.asp">visitors</A>
    site.
