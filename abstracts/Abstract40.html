In this paper we
critique
perceived deficiencies in current practices for analyzing operational
test metrics
and demonstrate how a Bayesian approach could be applied to operational
tests
to improve confidence in the assessment of the test results. We develop
an
approach and apply it to the analysis of Percent Blue (Friendly)
Survivors and Percent
Red (Threat) Killed as univariate measures of effectiveness in
operational
testing, using historical data.<o:p></o:p>
