<br>In our day-to-day discourse on uncertainty, words like belief,
chance, plausible, likelihood and probability are commonly encountered.
Often, these words are used interchangeably, because they are intended
to encapsulate some loosely articulated notions about the unknowns. The
purpose of this paper is to propose a framework that is able to show
how each of these terms can be made precise, so that each reflects a
distinct meaning. To construct our framework, we use a basic scenario
upon which caveats are introduced. Each caveat motivates us to bring in
one or more of the above notions. The scenario considered here is very
basic; it arises in both the biomedical context of survival analysis
and the industrial context of engineering reliability. This paper is
expository and much of what is said here has been said before. However,
the manner in which we introduce the material via a hierarchy of
caveats that could arise in practice, namely our proposed framework, is
the novel aspect of this paper. To appreciate all this, we require of
the reader a knowledge of the calculus of probability. However, in
order to make our distinctions transparent, probability has to be
interpreted subjectively, not as an objective relative frequency.<br><br>doi: </span><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">10.1080/07408170802322630</span><br><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"></span><br>
