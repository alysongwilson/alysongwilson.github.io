<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">ABSTRACT</span><br><br>Triangle
enumeration is a fundamental graph operation. Despite the lack of
provably effient (linear, or slightly superlinear) worst-case
algorithms for this problem, practitioners run simple, efficient
heuristics to find all triangles in graphs with millions of vertices.
How are these heuristics exploiting the structure of these special
graphs to provide major speedups in running time? <br><br>We study one
of the most prevalent algorithms used by practitioners. A trivial
algorithm enumerates all paths of length 2, and checks if each such
path is incident to a triangle. A good heuristic is to enumerate only
those paths of length 2 where the middle vertex has the lowest degree.
It is easily implemented and is empirically known to give remarkable
speedups over the trivial algorithm.<br><br>We study the behavior of
this algorithm over graphs with heavy-tailed degree distributions, a
defining feature of real-world graphs. The erased configuration model
(ECM) efficiently generates a graph with asymptotically (almost) any
desired degree sequence. We show that the expected running time of this
algorithm over the distribution of graphs created by the ECM is
controlled by the l<sub>4/3</sub>-norm of the degree sequence. As a
corollary of our main theorem, we prove expected linear-time
performance for degree sequences following a power law with exponent a
&gt;= 7/3, and non-trivial speedup whenever a in (2, 3).</span><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br><br></span>
