<br></span><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">The
systems that statisticians are asked to assess, such as nuclear
weapons, infrastructure networks, supercomputer codes and munitions,
have become increasingly complex. It is often costly to conduct full
system tests. As such, we present a review of methodology that has been
proposed for addressing system reliability with limited full system
testing. The first approaches presented in this paper are concerned
with the combination of multiple sources of information to assess the
reliability of a single component. The second general set of
methodology addresses the combination of multiple levels of data to
determine system reliability. We then present developments for complex
systems beyond traditional series/parallel representations through the
use of Bayesian networks and flowgraph models. We also include
methodological contributions to resource allocation considerations for
system relability assessment. We illustrate each method with
applications primarily encountered at Los Alamos National Laboratory.<br><br>doi:10.1214/088342306000000439</span><br>
