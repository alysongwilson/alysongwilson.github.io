<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">ABSTRACT</span><br><br>We
propose a series of Bayesian nonparametric statistical models for
community detection in graphs. We model the probability of the presence
or absence of edges within the graph. Using these models, we naturally
incorporate uncertainty and variability and take advantage of
nonparametric techniques, such as the Chinese restaurant process and
the Dirichlet process. Some of the contributions include: (a) the
community structure is directly modeled without specifying the number
of communities a priori; (b) the probabilities of edges within or
between communities may be modeled as varying by community or pairs of
communities; (c) some nodes can be classified as not belonging to any
community; and (d) Bayesian model diagnostics are used to compare
models and help with appropriate model selection. We start by fitting
an initial model to a well-known network dataset, and we develop a
series of increasingly complex models. We propose Markov chain Monte
Carlo algorithms to carry out the estimation as well as an approach for
community detection using the posterior distributions under a decision
theoretical framework. Bayesian nonparametric techniques allow us to
estimate the number and structure of communities from the data. To
evaluate the proposed models for the example dataset, we discuss model
comparison using the deviance information criterion and model checking
using posterior predictive distributions. Supplementary materials are
