<br></span><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">In
2006, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) completed its first
Bioterrorism Risk Assessment (BTRA), intended to be the foundation for
DHS's subsequent biennial risk assessments mandated by Homeland
Security Presidential Directive 10 (HSPD-10). At the request of DHS,
the National Research Council established the Committee on
Methodological Improvements to the Department of Homeland Security's
Biological Agent Risk Analysis to provide an independent, scientific
peer review of the BTRA. The Committee found a number of shortcomings
in the BTRA, including a failure to consider terrorists as intelligent
adversaries in the models, unnecessary complexity in threat and
consequence modeling and simulations, and a lack of focus on risk
management. The Committee unanimously concluded that an improved BTRA
is needed to provide a more credible foundation for risk-informed
decision making.<br><br>doi: 10.1089/bsp.2008.0930</span><br><br>
