stockpiles are expected to have high reliability over time, but
prudence demands regular testing to detect detrimental aging effects
and maintain confidence that reliability is high. We present a model,
called RADAR, in which a stockpile has high initial reliability that
may begin declining at any time. RADAR provides a framework for
answering questions about how confidence in continued high reliability
can change as a result of reduced sampling, discovery of failed units,
and information about when a unit failed.<br><br>doi:10.1198/TECH.2011.09119<br></span><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"></span><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"></span><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"></span>
