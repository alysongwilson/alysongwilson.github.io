<span class="">Assurance test plans are chosen to manage consumer's and
producer's risks. We develop methods for planning Bayesian assurance
tests for degradation data, i.e., on the basis of the degradation data
collected in the test, a decision is made whether to accept or reject a
product. Bayesian assurance tests incorporate prior knowledge in the
planning stage and use this information to evaluate posterior
consumer's and producer's risks. We consider prior knowledge that takes
the form of related degradation data. Assurance test plans are then
found that meet the specified requirements for consumer's and
producer's risks. We illustrate the planning of such assurance tests
with an example involving printhead migration data. We also investigate
the impact of measurement error on these assurance test plans.</span></span><br>
