<h2>Classes at North Carolina State University</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>ST 442: <a href="DataScience.html">Introduction to Data Sciences</a>.</strong>
Data Science has become increasingly important in nearly every industry
section and academic field. It has gained significant national
attention and interest by combining techniques from several fields like
Computer Science, Statistics, and mathematics to extract knowledge from
data. This course provides an overview of several foundational topics
in Data Science and will expose students to the theory and algorithms
underlying these techniques, as well as the use of common commercial
packages. The class will include a mix of lectures and programming
projects.</li>
<li><strong>ST 515: Experimental Statistics for Engineers
I.</strong>
General statistical concepts and techniques useful to research workers
in
engineering, textiles, wood technology, etc. Probability distributions,
measurement of precision, simple and multiple regression, tests of
significance, analysis of variance,enumeration data and experimental
design.</li>
<li><strong>ST 740: <a href="BayesianCourse.html">Bayesian Inference and Analysis</a>.</strong>
Introduction to Bayesian inference; specifying prior distributions;
conjugate priors, summarizing posterior information, predictive
distributions, hierachical models, asymptotic consistency and
