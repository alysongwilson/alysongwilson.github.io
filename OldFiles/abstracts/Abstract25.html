ability to estimate system reliability with an appropriate measure of
associated uncertainty is important for understanding its expected
performance over time. Frequently, obtaining full-system data is
prohibitively expensive, impractical, or not permissible. Hence,
methodology which allows for the combination of different types of data
at the component or subsystem levels can allow for improved estimation
at the system level. We apply methodologies for aggregating uncertainty
from component-level data to estimate system reliability and quantify
its overall uncertainty. This paper provides a proof-of-concept that
uncertainty quantification methods using Bayesian methodology can be
constructed and applied to system reliability problems for a system
with both series and parallel structures.<br><br></span><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">doi: 10.1016/j.ress.2010.09.012<br></span><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br></span><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"></span><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"></span>
