<br>
Risk analysis provides a scientific basis for making decisions in the
presence of uncertainty. It is an essential tool to identify,manage,
communicate, and assess risks. Each of these steps is complex and
requires careful thought. Risk assessment of rare events, particularly
in the reliability arena, and/or decisions against an intelligent
adversary are of significant importance in the national security
context. For a quantitative assessment, there are a multitude of
proposed frameworks in the literature. Given the need to leverage
multiple sources of information and the general sparsity of data, these
methods primarily follow the Bayesian paradigm. A brief introduction to
the Bayesian approach is provided, along with notes and considerations
for several quantitative risk assessment techniques.<o:p></o:p>
