aim to analyze the effects of component level reliability data,
including both catastrophic failures and margin failures, on system
level reliability. While much work has been done to analyze margins and
uncertainties at the component level, a gap exists in relating this
component level analysis to the system level. We apply methodologies
for aggregating uncertainty from component level data to quantify
overall system uncertainty. We explore three approaches towards this
goal, the classical Method of Moments (MOM), Bayesian, and Bootstrap
methods. These three approaches are used to quantify the uncertainty in
reliability for a system of mixed series and parallel components for
which both pass/fail and continuous margin data are available. This
paper provides proof of concept that uncertainty quantification methods
can be constructed and applied to system reliability problems. In
addition, application of these methods demonstrates that the results
from the three fundamentally different approaches can be quite
comparable.</span><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br><br></span><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">doi: 10.1016/j.ress.2010.10.006</span><br><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br></span><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"></span><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"></span>
