<br>
<span class="">Many scientists are drawn to statistics and
biostatistics by their passion to make a difference using their skills
in mathematics to tackle applied problems. We discuss a variety of
aspects of working in interdisciplinary teams, including expectations
and roles of statisticians and collaborators, authorship and
publication, funding expectations and alternatives, and combining
methodology with collaboration. This article summarizes a panel
discussion on interdisciplinary teams that took place at the inaugural
Women in Statistics Conference held in Cary, North Carolina, May 15&#8211;17,
2014, in which the panelists were asked to address several topics
relevant to working in interdisciplinary teams.</span></span><br>
