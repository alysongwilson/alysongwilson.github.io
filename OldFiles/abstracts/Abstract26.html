<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">ABSTRACT</span><br><br>Managers
and decision makers are often faced with difficult decisions balancing
multiple competing objectives when selecting between several strategies
for how to use the units in their inventory or stockpile. This paper
considers how to define different metrics which appropriately summarize
the objectives of a good strategy, how to consider what impact
unanticipated changes in the future might have, and how to combine
several criteria into a decision when no global winner is likely. This
process is discussed in the contrext of maximizing the reliability of a
population of single-use non-repairable units, such as missiles or
batteries, which are being consumerd (used and removed from the
population) as they age over time.<br><br>doi: 10.1177/1748006X11392287</span><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br></span><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"></span>
