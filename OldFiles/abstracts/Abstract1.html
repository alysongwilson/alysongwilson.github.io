similar levels of partial support provided by synchronized intermittent
mandatory ventilation (SIMV) and pressure support ventilation (PSV) in
terms of breathing comfort. On a single day, eligible subjects
experienced, in random order, both SIMV and PSV weaning protocols
(sequential 20% reductions in support at timed intervals) separated by
a 1 to 3 h rest. Breathing comfort was defined by subjective ratings of
dyspnea and anxiety. Subjects reported significant levels of preweaning
dyspnea and anxiety despite resting for at least 6 h. Dyspnea and
anxiety were not significantly different between the two methods at any
level of support. Our findings suggest that dyspnea and anxiety are
higher than expected on "full" ventilator support, and that comfort may
not differ between PSV and SIMV during active withdrawal of machine
support. <br><br>doi: 10.1164/ajrccm.149.1.8111572<br><br></span><a href="http://www.atsjournals.org.prox.lib.ncsu.edu/doi/abs/10.1164/ajrccm.149.1.8111572" style="color: rgb(32, 74, 156); font-family: 'Lucida Grande','Lucida Sans',Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 12px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; word-spacing: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"></a>
