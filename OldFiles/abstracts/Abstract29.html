repeatability and reproducibility (R&amp;R) studies are used to assess
precision of measurement systems. In particular, they are used to
quantify the importance of various sources of variability in a
measurement system. We take a Bayesian approach to data analysis and
show how to estimate variance components associated with the sources of
variability and relevant functions of these using the gauge R&amp;R
data together with prior information. We then provide worked examples
of gauge R&amp;R data analysis for types of studies common in
industrial applications. With each example we provide WinBUGS code to
illustrate how easy it is to implement a Bayesian analysis of gauge
R&amp;R data.<br><br>doi:10.1080/08982112.2012.702381<br></span><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"></span>
