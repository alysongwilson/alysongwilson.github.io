investigations frequently involve data from computer experiment(s) as
well as related physical experimental data on the same factors and
related response variable(s). There may also be one or more expert
opinions regarding the response of interest. Traditional statistical
approaches consider each of these datasets separately with
corresponding separate analyses and fitted statistical models. A
compelling argument can be made that better, more precise statistical
models can be obtained if the combined data are analyzed simultaneously
using a hierarchical Bayesian integrated modeling approach. However,
such an integrated approach must recognize important differences, such
as possible biases, in these experiments and expert opinions. We
illustrate our proposed integrated methodology by using it to model the
thermodynamic operation point of a top-spray fluidized bed
microencapsulation processing unit. Such units are used in the food
industry to tune the effect of functional ingredients and additives. An
important thermodynamic response variable of interest, Y, is the
steady-state outlet air temperature. In addition to a set of physical
experimental observations involving six factors used to predict Y,
similar results from three different computer models are also
available. The integrated data from the physical experiment and the
three computer models are used to fit an appropriate response surface
(regression) model for predicting Y.<br><br>doi: 10.1198/004017004000000211<br>
