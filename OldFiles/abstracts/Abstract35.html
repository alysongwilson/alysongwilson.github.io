Reliability is an essential element in assessing the operational
suitability of Department of Defense weapon systems. Reliability takes
a prominent role in both the design and analysis of operational tests.
In the current era of reduced budgets and increased reliability
requirements it is challenging to verify reliability requirements in a
single test. Furthermore, all available data should be considered in
order to ensure evaluations provide the most appropriate analysis of
the system&#8217;s reliability.</span><br class=""><br class=""><span class=""><span style="font-weight: bold;">Approach:</span>
This paper describes the benefits of using parametric statistical
models to combine information across multiple testing events. Both
frequentist and Bayesian inference techniques are employed, and they
are compared and contrasted to illustrate different statistical methods
for combining information. We apply these methods to data collected
during the developmental and operational test phases for the Stryker
family of vehicles.</span><br class=""><br class=""><span class=""><span style="font-weight: bold;">Results:</span>
We show that when we combine the available information across two test
phases for the Stryker family of vehicles, reliability estimates are
more accurate and precise than those reported previously using
traditional methods that use only operational test data in their
reliability assessments.</span></span><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br></span>
