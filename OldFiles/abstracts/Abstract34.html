students who have just completed an introductory statistics course
often lack deep understanding of variability and enthusiasm for the
field of statistics. This paper argues that by introducing the commonly
underemphasized concept of measurement error, students will have a
better chance of attaining both. We further present lecture materials
and activities that introduce metrology, the science of measurement,
which were developed and tested in a pilot study at Iowa State
University. These materials explain how to characterize sources of
variability in a dataset, in a way that is natural and accessible
because the sources of variability are observable. Everyday examples of
measurements, such as the amount of gasoline pumped into a car, are
presented, and the consequences of variability within those
measurements are discussed. To gauge the success of the material,
students&#8217; initial and subsequent understanding of variability and their
attitude toward the usefulness of statistics were analyzed in a
comparative study. Questions from the CAOS and ARTIST assessments that
pertain to using variability to make comparisons, understanding the
standard deviation, and using graphical representations of variability
were included in the assessment. The results of the comparative study
indicate that most students who were exposed to the material improved
their understanding of variability and had a greater appreciation of
the value of statistics.</span><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br><br></span>
