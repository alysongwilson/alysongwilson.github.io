<br>
<span class="">Geospatial semantic graphs provide a robust foundation
for representing and analyzing remote sensor data. In particular, they
support a variety of pattern search operations that capture the spatial
and temporal relationships among the objects and events in the data.
However, in the presence of large data corpora, even a carefully
constructed search query may return a large number of unintended
matches. This work considers the problem of calculating a quality score
for each match to the query, given that the underlying data are
uncertain. We present a preliminary evaluation of three methods for
determining both match quality scores and associated uncertainty
bounds, illustrated in the context of an example based on overhead
imagery data.</span></span><br>
