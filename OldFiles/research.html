<p> My
research
interests are in the intersection of engineering statistics and
Bayesian methods, with particular emphasis on problems in defense and
security.</p>
<h2>Labs and Consortia<br>

<ul>
<li>I am the Principal Investigator for the <a href="http://ncsu-las.org">Laboratory for Analytic Sciences</a>.
LAS is a translational research laboratory sponsored by the
Intelligence Community and NCSU to develop technology-enabled,
mission-oriented analysis tradecraft. See the <a href="http://magazine.amstat.org/blog/2014/01/01/nc-state-nsa-grant/">article</a>
about LAS in <em>Amstat News</em>.</li>
<li>I am a co-investigator in the recently-awarded
Consortium for Nonproliferation Enabling Capabilities, sponsored by the
National Nuclear Security Administration. In particular, I am the
thrust leader for the Data Fusion and Analytic Techniques research
area. This is a $25M, 5 year grant. See the <a href="http://www.newsobserver.com/2014/04/16/3788899/ncsu-to-lead-25-million-research.html">coverage</a>

<h3>Combining Information to Assess System Reliability</h3>
<p>In the Department of Defense (DoD), data are often collected
over
several phases of tests. A key initiative across the DoD testing and
evaluation community has been to integrate test planning and execution
to create data that can be shared by all test agencies. However, no one
has yet capitalized on the knowledge that can be gained when one
properly combines information across all of these test events.</p>
<p>This work is funded by the Science of Test
Consortium. James Gilman is working on this project.</p>

<h3>Bayesian Reliability Models</h3>
<p>Bayesian
techniques and tools have proven useful in addressing a variety of
reliability problems. Bayesian methods allow heterogeneous information
to be expressed probabilistically, and Bayesian computational tools
have been used to address otherwise intractable estimation and
inference problems.</p>

<h3>Designing Experiments for Reliability</h3>
<p> In the current era of smaller budgets and
increasing reliability requirements, it is challenging to demonstrate
reliability requirements using a single test. Reliability assurance
testing uses supplementary data and information to reduce the required
amount of testing. The additional data and information may include
appropriate reliability models, earlier test results on the same or
similar devices, expert judgment regarding performance, knowledge of
the environmental conditions under which the devices are used,
benchmark design information on similar devices, prior knowledge of
possible failure modes, etc.</p>

Consortium. James Gilman is working on this project.</p>

<h3>Bayesian Reliability Growth Modeling</h3>
<p>The various stages of system development involve maturation of
the
design through the discovery and mitigation of failure modes that are
initially present in the system. A number of approaches have been
proposed to model the growth in reliability throughout system
development, each with their own applications, assumptions, and
limitations. Bayesian methods use multiple sources of information to
develop and update reliability growth plans.</p>

<h3>Combining Information to Improve Nonproliferation Capabilities</h3>
<p>This
research will Identify and create tools that can be used to collect,
fuse, and analyze data from multiple sensors to support the
identification of signatures, decisions about data collection, and
development of simulation and modeling methodology.</p>
