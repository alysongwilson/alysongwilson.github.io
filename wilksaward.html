					<p>The Samuel S. Wilks Memorial Medal and Award was established in 1964 with a $5,000 gift from Mr. Philip B. Rust of Thomasville, Georgia. The original <a href="https://www.amstat.org/ASA/Your-Career/Awards/Samuel-S-Wilks-Memorial-Award.aspx">Wilks Memorial Medal Award</a>, initiated by the U.S. Army and the American Statistician Association jointly, is administered by the American Statistical Association, a non-profit educational and scientific society founded in 1839. The Wilks Award is given each year to a statistician and is based primarily on his contribution to the advancement of scientific or technical knowledge in Army statistics, ingenious application of such knowledge, or successful activity in the fostering of cooperation scientific matters which coincidentally benefit the Army, the Department of Defense, the US Government, and our country generally.</p> 
<p>Philip Rust made another gift for the establishment of a second Wilks award, called “The Wilks Award for Contributions to Statistical Methodologies in Army Research, Development, and Testing.”  The new Army Wilks Award is given periodically at a series of conferences (Design of Experiments, Army Conference on Applied Statistics, Conference on Applied Statistics in Defense, and now DATAWorks) to a deserving individual who has made a substantial contribution to statistical methodology and application impacting the practice of statistics in the Army through personal research in statistics or application of statistics in the solution of Army problems. The award was established to commemorate the career of Prof. Samuel S. Wilks and especially his service to the Army.</p>
