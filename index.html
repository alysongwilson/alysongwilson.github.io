Initiatives at North Carolina State University. She is also a professor 
in the <a href="https://statistics.sciences.ncsu.edu/">Department of Statistics</a> and Principal Investigator for the 
<a href="http://ncsu-las.org">Laboratory for Analytic Sciences</a>. 
She is a Fellow of the American Statistical Association and the American Association for the Advancement of Science. 
Her research interests include statistical reliability, Bayesian methods, and the application of statistics to problems in defense 
and national security. She is the Director of the NC State <a href="https://research.ncsu.edu/dsi/">Data Science Initiative</a> 
and coordinator of NC State's <a href="https://facultyclusters.ncsu.edu/">Data-Driven Science faculty cluster</a>.</p>
					
<p>Prior to joining NC State, Dr. Wilson was a research staff member at the <a href="https://www.ida.org/en/ida-ffrdcs/science-and-technology-policy-institute">
IDA Science and Technology Policy Institute</a> in 
Washington, DC (2011-2013), where she helped provide research support to the White House Office of Science and 
Technology Policy and the Office of the Secretary of Defense. Before her move to Washington, Dr. Wilson was an associate professor 
in the <a href="https://www.stat.iastate.edu/">Department of Statistics</a> at Iowa State University (2008-2011). From 1999-2008, 
she was a project leader and technical lead for Department of Defense Programs in the 
<a href="https://www.lanl.gov/org/ddste/aldsc/computer-computational-statistical-sciences/statistical-sciences/index.php">
Statistical Sciences Group</a> at Los Alamos National Laboratory. In this role, she developed and led a portfolio of 
work in the application of statistics to the reliability of conventional and nuclear weapons. Dr. Wilson continues her 
collaboration with Los Alamos as a guest scientist.</p>

<p>Prior to her move to Los Alamos, Dr. Wilson was a senior statistician and operations research analyst with 
Cowboy Programming Resources (1995-1999), where she planned, executed, and analyzed U. S. Army air defense artillery
operational evaluations. From 1990-1991, she was a mathematical statistician at the National Institutes of Health.</p>

Defense and National Security.</p>

<p>In addition to numerous publications, Dr. Wilson has co-authored a book, Bayesian Reliability, and has co-edited two 			
other books, <i>Statistical Methods in Counterterrorism: Game Theory, Modeling, Syndromic Surveillance, and Biometric Authentication</i>
and <i>Modern Statistical and Mathematical Methods in Reliability</i>. She holds a patent for her early work in medical imaging.</p>

<p>Dr. Wilson received her Ph.D. in Statistics from Duke University, her M.S. in Statistics from Carnegie-Mellon University, and her B.A. in Mathematical Sciences from Rice University.</p>
